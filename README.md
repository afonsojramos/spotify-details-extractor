<h1 align="center"> Spotify Details Extractor ðŸŽ¶ </h1>

Simple browser extension to extract Spotify details from an album page in a specific JSON object. You can find it in any context menu/extension bar near you!

**PS**: This extension tries to be the least intrusive possible and will only show up in the context menu when you are in the Spotify Web App in the case of the Firefox browser. On Chromium, the extension will show as disabled on other websites. Additionally, in Firefox, since Spotify captures the user's `Right Click`, you need to press `Shift` + `Right Click` for it to show up. This does not work in Chromium, which is why the implementation is different.

## Manual Installation

### Firefox

Navigate to `about:addons`, select **Install Add-on From File...** and choose the `.xpi` extension that you've downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/afonsojramos/spotify-details-extractor/releases/latest).

### Chromium

Navigate to `chrome://extensions` and drag the `.crx` extension that you've downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/afonsojramos/spotify-details-extractor/releases/latest).

### Spicetify

Navigate to `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` and download `extractor.js` that can be found in the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/afonsojramos/spotify-details-extractor/releases/latest). Then, using `spicetify config extensions extractor.js`, enable the extension.

## Motivation

Currently, my personal website uses a [JSON Database](https://github.com/afonsojramos/afonsojramos.me/blob/main/data/music.json) to store the details of my favorite albums of the year.

Each entry is constructed by the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "title": "For the first time",
  "artist": "Black Country, New Road",
  "image": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e020ffaa4f75b2297d36ff1e0ad",
  "url": "https://open.spotify.com/album/2PfgptDcfJTFtoZIS3AukX"
}
```

The resulting page can be seen in [afonsojramos.me/music](afonsojramos.me/music).

However, the process of extracting the details from the album page is quite tedious as I have to **manually** copy the album's URL, and extract the album's title, artist and image URL. All of this requires the opening of the developer's console and makes the process rather slow.

Therefore, I decided to create a browser extension that will **extract the details** from the album page, store them in the desired JSON object, and **automatically copy it to the clipboard**.

## Implementation

Initially, I was going to create an extension that would create an in-page button that would trigger the events. I was somewhat successful in this (it works perfectly on Spicetify), but on Spotify's Web App things are a bit more complicated as it meant interacting with the page's DOM, which I preferred not to do as it would be more prone to errors.

With this in mind, `v2` shifted to a simple context menu on Firefox and the extension button on Chromium, due to the latter not supporting context menus. These proved to be way more reliable and faster than the previous approach.
